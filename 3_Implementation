First of all, we will make a connection to the LM35 Temperature Sensor. 
Connect 
the 1st pin of LM35 to 5V of Arduino UNO and 3rd Pin to GND. 
Similarly, connect the 2nd pin to Analog input pin A0 of Arduino UNO 
Now we will connect the 16Ã—2 LCD to the Arduino. 
1. Connect pin 1,3,5,16 of LCD to the GND. 
2. Connect pin 2,15 of LCD to the VCC (5V). 
3. Connect pin 4 of LCD to pin D8 of Arduino. 
3. Connect pin 6 of LCD to pin D9 of Arduino. 
3. Connect pin 11 of LCD to pin D10 of Arduino. 
3. Connect pin 12 of LCD to pin D11 of Arduino. 
3. Connect pin 13 of LCD to pin D12 of Arduino. 
3. Connect pin 14 of LCD to pin D13 of Arduino.
